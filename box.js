// Arrays

// Arrays allow us to hold more than one value in a single variable
// Array indexes start from 0
// Each item in an array is named an element
// Arrays should be declared using const as they cannot be reassinged
// Arrays can be manipulated using a variety of array methods

// Array methods we will look at today
// .length - tells us the length of the array
// .push - adds an element to the end of the array
// . pop - removes an element from the end of an array
// . unshift - adds an element to the start of an array
// .shift - removes an element from the start of an array
// .indexOf - tells you the index of an array

// .unshift

// Please look into
// .splice() array
// .slice() array

// Also look do while loop

// do while loop
// The do while loop is a variant of the while loop
// This loop will execute the code block once, before checking if the condition is true
// then it will repeat the loop as long as the condition is true
// example : based on points variable above initialised as 0

// question 6
// create a number that the user has to guess (if you can make it random)
// Ask the user to guess a number and that they have 3 attempts
// allow the user to have 3 attempts, it may be best to countdown rather than up.
// if the user has 0 attempts left alert them to tell them.
// if they guess to low let them know the number was to low
// if the number was to high let them know the number is to high
// if the guess is not to low and not to high give the user a point, alert them to congratulate them and the stop the code running using break
//

// solution
